Portal-proof walls

Handheld Portal Device
---------------------------------------
 + progs/v_portal.mdl (thanks, toneddu2000!)

[+] creates portals
[+] not on every surface (some tiled floors, metal, doors, windows...)

[-] crosshair: yellow and blue part of oval. when blue portal is fired, only yellow part visible & vice versa
   -> three crosshairs (qc can't change crosshairs, afaik)
[-] shooting an orange portal on an existing blue portal (vice versa) will create the portal right next to it, 
  if the room available allows it.
[-] portal on wall should never overlap to the underground/other wall - check the height first... (that would be sweet)



Turrets
-------
[-] red eye is actually infrared beam
[-] full of ammo, shoots everything that moves in his field of sight (not very wide)
[-] can be disabled (?)

Aperture Science High Energy Pellet system
------------------------------------------
[+] launcher produces energy balls (one hit kills) repetitively after some period of time (long), which is same as the lifespawn of ball.
     => one ball dies, another ball comes
[-] in advanced levels the green variant appears; it doesn't explode at all. 
[-] when grabbed with Portal Gun, balls explode
[+] when ball hits catcher, it will pull the trigger -> open door, activate platform. Catcher is one use only.

1500 Megawatt Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button
-----------------------------------------------------
[-] can be weighted with Cube or Player.
[-] only on floor
[-] ??momentary or toggle??
[+] weighted pulls trigger

Advanced Knee Replacement
-------------------------
[+] just disable damage from falling (client.qc)

Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid
